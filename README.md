# Lab2B_ESP

## Challenges
- Which parts of the lab specification have you found most confusing or difficult to understand?
  Lab parts 8,9 were really confusing. Part 08 required us to control the APDS using the PIO module, but that was very vague and it was difficult to figure out what that means or how we approach it. 
Lab 9 says that the timings modeled in the last lab may be used to capture color, but delivery, packet delivery, and brightness change. But we were not sure how to implement that.
